![Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/Filter-Type--I%20Butterworth-blue)

MATLAB-based analysis of Butterworth low-pass filters (orders 1â€“5) with visualization of frequency response, impulse response, and signal convolution.

---

## Features

- Analyze Butterworth filters of orders 1 to 5
- Derive transfer functions and FIR using Laplace Transforms
- Calculate frequency response using Fourier Transform
- Simulate the effect of filtering on cosine input signals
- Graphical comparison of transfer and frequency characteristics

## Installation

### Prerequisities

- MATLAB (version R2023a or compatible)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/konrad-wlodarczyk/butterworth-filter-analysis.git
   cd butterworth-filter-analysis

2. Open the **`project.m`** script in MATLAB and run it to start the analysis.

### File Structure

- **`project.m`**
  Main script that runs the entire analysis.
  
- **`CustomResidue.m`**
  Computes residues and poles for Laplace domain inversion.
  
- **`InverseLaplaceTransform.m`**
  Generates the FIR from poles and residues.
  
- **`FourierTransform.m`**
  Approximates the continuous-time Fourier Transform.
